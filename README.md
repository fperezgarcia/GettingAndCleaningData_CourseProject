Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The project includes:

1) a tidy data set as described in the codebook

2) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations (CodeBook.md)

3) a README.md file describing the project

4) R script (run_analysis.R) that performs the following operations:
	- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

	- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

	- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

	- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 

	- Creates the tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
